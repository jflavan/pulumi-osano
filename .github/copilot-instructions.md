# Copilot onboarding for `pulumi-osano`

Concise, task-agnostic instructions so an agent can work efficiently without extra repo exploration. Trust these steps first; search only when something here is missing or incorrect. Keep changes minimal and follow the Pulumi provider boilerplate patterns.

## What this repo is
- Unofficial Pulumi **native provider** for Osano's Cookie Consent Customer REST API and Unified Consent API (Go provider built on `pulumi-go-provider` v1.6.0 `infer`, plus generated SDKs for Node/TS, Python, Go, .NET, Java).
- Published from v0.1.0 (2026-09-25): npm `@jflavan/pulumi-osano`, PyPI `pulumi-osano` (import `pulumi_osano`), NuGet `Community.Pulumi.Osano`, Go `github.com/jflavan/pulumi-osano/sdk/go/osano` (tags `sdk/go/osano/vX.Y.Z`), Maven Central `io.github.jflavan.pulumi:pulumi-osano`. The provider plugin ships as GitHub release archives (`github://api.github.com/jflavan/pulumi-osano`), and the SDKs download it automatically. The provider is not in the Pulumi Registry yet. See `docs/PUBLISHING.md`.
- Large repo with many docs/examples; core source lives in `provider/`, generated SDKs in `sdk/`, examples in `examples/`, docs in `docs/`.
- Toolchain versions managed by **mise** (`.config/mise.toml`): Go from the `go.mod` toolchain line (currently go1.27.1; the `go` directive is 1.26.6) and Pulumi from the `github.com/pulumi/pulumi/pkg/v3` version in `go.mod` (currently 3.264.0; both via `scripts/get-versions.sh`), Node `24.13.0`, Python `3.11.8`, .NET `10.0.401`, Java `corretto-11`, Gradle `7.6.6`, pulumictl `0.0.50`, schema-tools `0.6.0`, golangci-lint `2.14.0` (2.7.2 cannot lint a go 1.26+ module), yarn `1.22.22`. Pulumi home pinned to `.pulumi` in repo.

## Bootstrap (do this first)
1. From repo root, activate tools: `eval "$(mise activate bash)" && mise install`. This installs pulumictl/schema-tools etc. and avoids “pulumictl: not found” during builds.
2. Ensure Go/Pulumi in PATH: `go version`, `pulumi version`.
3. For IDE/tests, export Osano credentials if needed:
  - `export OSANO_API_KEY="customer-rest-cmp-key"`
  - `export OSANO_UC_API_KEY="unified-consent-key"`
  These are required only for examples or integration tests that hit the real API.

## Build, lint, and test (validated commands)
- **Provider unit tests (validated locally):**
  - `make test_provider` (runs `go test -short` in `provider/`, ~2–3 minutes). Succeeds locally; saw harmless preamble `pulumictl: not found` when tools not installed—run mise to suppress.
- **Code generation rule (critical):** After any change in `provider/`, run `make codegen` to refresh `provider/cmd/.../schema.json` and all SDKs. CI fails if the worktree is dirty.
- **Build provider only:** `make provider` (outputs `bin/pulumi-resource-osano`).
- **Full build (provider + SDKs):** `make build` (calls `make build_sdks`; heavier).
- **Lint:** `make lint` (golangci-lint using `.golangci.yml` with `--fix`, so it rewrites files; CI temporarily rewrites `go:embed` to ` goembed`).
- **Examples:** Example programs in `examples/` serve as documentation. `make build_examples` compiles the Cookie Consent examples and the Go quickstart without contacting Osano; run `pulumi up` only for an intentional live test with customer credentials.
- **E2E compile check:** `make test_e2e_compile` vets every `tests/e2e` build-tag set without credentials.
- **Engine-level pipeline e2e:** `make test_pipeline_e2e` builds the provider and runs a Pulumi YAML program with the `pulumi` CLI (`up`, `preview`, `refresh`, `destroy`) against an in-process mock Osano API (`tests/e2e/pipeline`, build tags `e2e pipeline`, opt-in `OSANO_RUN_PIPELINE_E2E=1`, which the target sets). Needs the Pulumi CLI on `PATH`, no credentials; CI runs it as the `pipeline_e2e` job.
- **Language SDK builds (after codegen):** `make build_nodejs|build_python|build_dotnet|build_java` (`build_go` is an empty CI stub; `make go_sdk` generates the Go SDK); they expect dependencies from mise and may write artifacts under `sdk/*`.

## Project layout shortcuts
- `provider/`: Go provider implementation (`provider.go`, `config.go` (provider config and its `DiffConfig`), `client.go` and `consent_resource.go` for Unified Consent, `functions.go` for Unified Consent invokes, `customer_client.go` and `cookie_consent_*.go` for Cookie Consent (`cookie_consent_functions.go` holds the `getCookieConsent*` invokes, `cookie_consent_configuration.go` the configuration checks and refresh projection), `internal/osano` for the Customer REST client, plus tests). `schema_test.go` fails when any resource, function, input, or output lacks a description. Entry binary at `provider/cmd/pulumi-resource-osano/main.go`; schema extracted to `provider/cmd/.../schema.json`.
- `sdk/`: Generated; do not hand-edit. Language-specific READMEs under each SDK.
- `examples/`: Extensive Pulumi programs serving as documentation and reference implementations.
- `docs/`: Guides, troubleshooting, and design/plan artifacts under `docs/superpowers/`.
- `Makefile`: All build/test targets and codegen steps; uses `pulumictl convert-version` and `pulumi package gen-sdk`.
- Config & lint: `.config/mise.toml`, `.golangci.yml`. The Pulumi CLI version is derived from `go.mod` by `scripts/get-versions.sh`.
- GitHub Actions: `build.yml` (push to main) and `run-acceptance-tests.yml` (every pull request, plus the `/run-acceptance-tests` comment command for fork PRs) run codegen, provider build/tests, the SDK matrix build, example and e2e compilation (`build_examples` job), lint, and read-only acceptance tests when secrets exist; `run-acceptance-tests.yml` also runs the engine-level pipeline suite (`pipeline_e2e` job, no secrets); `pull-request.yml` posts a PR comment for maintainers on fork PRs; `release.yml` publishes on a `vX.Y.Z` tag push: the GitHub release with archives, SBOMs, checksums and build provenance attestations (GoReleaser); npm, PyPI and NuGet with trusted publishing; Maven Central with the `MAVEN_CENTRAL_*` and `JAVA_SIGNING_*` secrets; and the `sdk/go/osano/vX.Y.Z` tag. A manual run is always a dry run. Every publishing step skips a version the registry already reports, so **Re-run failed jobs** is safe; right after a publish the npm and Maven Central lookups can miss the new version, and that step then fails without republishing (see `docs/RELEASE_GUIDE.md`). `codeql.yml` (CodeQL Advanced) runs CodeQL `security-extended` for Actions, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python on pull requests and pushes to `main`, weekly, and on demand. Pull requests are analyzed in full (diff-informed analysis off); each `Analyze` job fails when the PR introduces a CodeQL alert with no counterpart open or dismissed on `main` (`.github/scripts/fail-on-new-codeql-alerts.sh`), and the `main` ruleset requires the `CodeQL gate` job plus the `CodeQL` results check and up-to-date branches. Keep its file name, job ids, the `CodeQL gate` name, matrix languages, and categories stable, keep `codeql-action/init` and `analyze` on the same SHA, and leave code scanning default setup off.

## Working tips to avoid CI friction
- Always run `make codegen` after touching `provider/` Go code, then commit generated changes.
- Ensure tools from mise are installed before any Make target to avoid missing pulumictl/schema-tools.
- Keep changes surgical; avoid editing generated `sdk/` files directly—regenerate instead.
- Provider unit tests use mocked HTTP and do not require Osano API credentials.
- CI lint job briefly replaces `go:embed` with ` goembed` before running golangci-lint; you do not need to do this locally—just avoid committing any such rewrites if you see them.
- CI checks for a clean worktree; ensure `git status` clean after codegen/build.
- Editing `README.md`: codegen copies it byte for byte to `sdk/nodejs/README.md`, `sdk/python/README.md`, and `sdk/dotnet/README.md`. Update those copies in the same commit (`make codegen`, or copy the file preserving LF line endings), or CI fails the worktree-clean check.
- Never bump versions in files. The committed schema and SDKs stay at `0.1.0-alpha.0+dev` (Makefile `PROVIDER_VERSION`), and `release.yml` stamps the version from the `vX.Y.Z` tag. See `docs/RELEASE_GUIDE.md`.

## When to search
Use search only if these instructions lack a needed detail or observed behavior diverges (e.g., new targets or errors). Otherwise rely on this file for fast execution.
