# State Management

Pulumi stores each resource's inputs and outputs in stack state. Keep production
and development stacks separate so credentials, test subjects, and Cookie
Consent configurations are not mixed.

## Secrets and public installation outputs

Store API keys in encrypted Pulumi configuration:

```bash
pulumi config set osano:osanoApiKey --secret
pulumi config set osano:unifiedConsentApiKey --secret
```

Environment variables `OSANO_API_KEY` and `OSANO_UC_API_KEY` are supported for
CI. Inferred provider API-key properties can appear in provider state, but the
schema marks them `secret: true`; never place credentials in ordinary resource
inputs, outputs, `changeToken`, or diagnostics. Mark subject identifiers and
other PII with Pulumi secret helpers as well.

The schema marks these values secret, so Pulumi encrypts them in state and
masks them in output:

- `CookieConsentPublication.webhookUrl`: Osano calls it without authentication,
  so the URL itself is the only protection.
- `Consent.sessionToken`.
- The `session` input and output of `verifySubjectCode` and `sendSubjectCode`,
  and `verifySubjectCode.code`.
- The personal-data outputs of `getSubjectProfile` (`email`, `profile`) and
  `getSession` (`profile`), and the `getSession.sessionId` input.

`CookieConsentPublication.scriptSrc` and `scriptTag`, and the same outputs of
`getCookieConsentConfig` and `getCookieConsentConfigs`, contain only the public
customer/config installation path. They are deliberately non-secret so they can
feed site deployment resources and other stacks.

## Cookie Consent lifecycle

- `CookieConsentConfig` state stores the inputs as applied plus Osano's
  publication metadata. Refresh surfaces drift in declared values, but the
  `configuration` object tracks only the keys the program declares, recursively
  into nested objects such as `palette` and `translations`, so keys Osano adds
  on its side never produce a diff and `pulumi up --refresh` with no edits is a
  no-op. A declared key that Osano omits keeps its declared value.
  `variantMapping` is compared as a whole, so jurisdictions added in Osano show
  as drift. An import, which has no declared keys, adopts the whole
  configuration Osano reports. Its delete is state-only because Osano exposes
  no configuration delete endpoint.
- `CookieConsentRule` uses `<configId>/<ruleId>` identity. Deleting the Pulumi
  resource deletes the managed rule from Osano; a missing upstream rule is
  treated as already deleted.
- `CookieConsentPublication` stores the desired publication options and
  caller-managed `changeToken` along with observed status, revision, and script
  outputs. Changing the token or an option causes an update and republish;
  unchanged inputs are a no-op.
- Publication delete is state-only because Osano exposes no unpublish endpoint.
  The upstream configuration and previously published script remain active.
- Provider configuration changes (API key rotation, `requestTimeoutSeconds`,
  base URLs) update the provider in place and never replace the resources it
  manages. An SDK upgrade changes only the provider as well: default providers
  are named after their version, so the new one is created and the old one
  deleted, and an explicit provider resource records the new `version` with an
  in-place update.

Build `changeToken` deterministically from every publish-relevant desired
configuration and rule value. Do not hash API keys or depend on unstable map
ordering. Explicit dependencies ensure the publication waits for configuration
and rule updates; the token ensures those desired-state changes trigger an
update.

## Refresh, preview, import, and destroy

- `pulumi preview` does not publish or otherwise mutate the Customer REST API.
- `pulumi refresh` only reads. It can expose an externally changed publication
  as `outdated` but never republishes it.
- Import only reads. Publication import adopts
  `import:<lastPublished>:<publishedRevision>`; applying a program with a
  different intended token may cause one controlled republish.
- `pulumi destroy` deletes managed rules, but configuration/publication removal
  is state-only. Immutable Unified Consent submissions also remain upstream.

For Unified Consent resources, refresh looks the subject up by its `verifiedId`
or `anonymousId` (both are subject references to Osano), checks that it still
has consent, and updates `lastSynced`; it keeps the submitted inputs rather than
the subject's merged consent view, so a refresh never triggers a replacement.
If Osano reports no consent for the subject, refresh removes the resource from
state and the next `pulumi up` submits it again. A GPC consent also stores the
actions Osano derived in `gpcActions`. Consent submissions are append-only
events, so removing a logical Pulumi resource never erases the historical Osano
record.

Use Pulumi state diffs and audit logs to understand who applied each desired
state, and `getCookieConsentAuditLog` to see Osano's side: publications and
configuration or rule changes, including edits made in the dashboard. Review
retained Osano configurations separately after stack teardown.
