# Release Checklist

Use this checklist whenever publishing a new `pulumi-osano` provider release.
[RELEASE_GUIDE.md](RELEASE_GUIDE.md) explains each step in detail.

1. **Check the one-time setup** (in place since `v0.1.0`; recheck after rotating credentials or
   changing a publisher)
   - Repository secrets exist: `NUGET_USERNAME`, `MAVEN_CENTRAL_USERNAME`,
     `MAVEN_CENTRAL_PASSWORD`, `JAVA_SIGNING_KEY`, `JAVA_SIGNING_KEY_ID`, and
     `JAVA_SIGNING_PASSWORD`. `NPM_TOKEN` is not set and not needed.
   - Trusted publishers point at owner `jflavan`, repository `pulumi-osano`, workflow
     `release.yml`, and no environment: the npm trusted publisher for `@jflavan/pulumi-osano`
     (with **npm publish** allowed), the PyPI trusted publisher for `pulumi-osano`, and the NuGet
     trusted publishing policy.
   - The Maven Central namespace `io.github.jflavan` is verified, and the signing public key
     (fingerprint `5277 E261 0B7E 7021 6871  969A 4809 7CF9 4C3F 74F3`) is on
     `keyserver.ubuntu.com` and `keys.openpgp.org`.
2. **Do not bump versions in files**
   - The release version comes from the tag. The committed schema and SDKs stay at the Makefile's
     development version (`0.1.0-alpha.0+dev`); the release workflow stamps the real version.
3. **Run the quality gates on `main`**

   ```bash
   make codegen
   make test_provider
   make build_sdks
   make build_examples
   make test_e2e_compile
   git diff --exit-code
   ```

   - Also run `make provider` so the version-stamped Go provider compiles and
     `make lint` to execute `golangci-lint` with repository defaults.
   - The final diff check proves schema, SDKs, and copied package READMEs are current.
   - Confirm the latest `CodeQL Advanced` run on `main` succeeded and that
     **Security and quality > Code scanning** shows no open critical or high alerts.
   - Check that `github/codeql-action` in `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` is on the
     latest v4 release. If it is not, bump `init` and `analyze` to the same commit
     SHA in one change, and update the `# vX.Y.Z` comments.
4. **Run a release dry run**
   - `gh workflow run release.yml --ref main` (or **Actions > release > Run workflow** on `main`).
     Manual runs never publish.
   - Every job must pass: the provider and SDK builds, `publish (dry run)` (GoReleaser snapshot
     and archive names), `publish_sdks (dry run)` (`npm publish --dry-run`, `twine check`, the
     `.nupkg`, the Go SDK tag), and `publish_java_sdk (dry run)` (`publishToMavenLocal`).
5. **Validate documentation**
   - README quickstart instructions must reflect the published install paths.
   - Repo-local examples must clearly document any required local SDK build steps.
   - Cookie Consent docs must agree that preview/refresh/import do not publish,
     rules delete upstream, and configuration/publication deletes are state-only.
   - The Pulumi Registry pages `docs/_index.md` and `docs/installation-configuration.md` match
     the provider's resources, functions, and configuration, start with YAML front matter, and
     use only absolute links.
   - `docs/PUBLISHING.md` and the README badges and install commands name the published
     packages, and the version-pinned commands name the new version: the README's Java and plugin
     commands, `docs/PUBLISHING.md`, `docs/UPGRADE.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md`, the
     released-package sections of the example READMEs, and, for a new minor version, the
     supported-versions table in `SECURITY.md`.
6. **Update the changelog**
   - In the release PR, move the `## [Unreleased]` entries of `CHANGELOG.md` into
     `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and add its compare link. Date it with the day you tag (UTC),
     never a guessed date.
   - Summarize user-facing changes, new resources, and breaking updates.
   - Highlight Osano API version changes and any new required scopes.
   - For Cookie Consent changes, call out `scriptSrc`, `scriptTag`, the
     caller-managed `changeToken`, default preservation of unclassified
     discoveries, composite rule imports, and configurations/publications
     retained upstream after destroy.
7. **Tag and publish**
   - After the release PR merges: `git checkout main && git pull && git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
   - Verify the GitHub Actions `release` workflow completes successfully for provider binaries and every SDK.
   - If a job fails, fix the cause and use **Re-run failed jobs**; publishing steps skip versions
     that are already published. If the `publish` (GoReleaser) job failed after creating the
     GitHub release, delete the release (keep the tag) first. Never move a published tag.
   - Confirm npm, PyPI, NuGet, Maven Central, and Go publication all completed before announcing the release.
8. **Post-release follow-up**
   - Check that the plugin installs:
     `pulumi plugin install resource osano X.Y.Z --server github://api.github.com/jflavan/pulumi-osano`.
   - Verify provenance and signatures as described in `docs/PUBLISHING.md` (for example
     `gh attestation verify pulumi-resource-osano-vX.Y.Z-linux-amd64.tar.gz --owner jflavan`).
     Allow 10 to 30 minutes for Maven Central to reach `repo1.maven.org`, and use
     `npm view --prefer-online` if npm shows a stale 404.
   - The npm bootstrap was done for `v0.1.0`. It is needed again only for a brand-new npm
     package; see "npm: bootstrap, then trusted publishing" in the release guide.
   - Not done yet: the provider is not in the Pulumi Registry. List it once: open a PR to
     [pulumi/registry](https://github.com/pulumi/registry) that adds
     `{"repoSlug": "jflavan/pulumi-osano", "schemaFile": "provider/cmd/pulumi-resource-osano/schema.json"}`
     to `community-packages/package-list.json` and `"John Flavan": "john_flavan"` to
     `tools/resourcedocsgen/pkg/publishers/publisher-names.json`, then fix anything the PR's
     automated fact sheet flags and comment `/check`. Later releases are picked up by the
     registry automatically within a day; confirm the new version at
     `https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/osano/`.
   - Monitor issues for regressions.

Keep the checklist updated as automation improves.
